<p>Homemade pizza dough is easy and costs pennies on the dollar compared to store bought. Make a batch now and freeze it for later!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>3/4 cups warm water</li>
    <li>1 tsp yeast</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sugar</1i>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Dissolve the yest and suag in the warm water. Allow the yeast water to sit for about 5 minutes, or until a thick layer of foam develops on top.</li>
    <li>While you're watiing for the yeast, add 1 cup of the flour and the salt to a large bowl, then stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Add the olive oil to the yeast water, then pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour and salt. Begin adding more flour to the bowl, 1/4 to 1/2 at a time, until it forms a ball of dough that can no longer be stirred with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, then knead for about 5 minutes, adding a little flour as you go to keep it from sticking.</li>
    <li>Place the kneaded dough back into the mixing bowl, drizzle with a little oil, then turn the dough to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl loosely and let the dough rise in a warm place for one hour, or until it is double in volume.</li>
    <li>Once risen, stretch or roll the dough out to a 14 to 16 in circle, place on a pizza pan, and top with your favorite sauce and toppings. Bake the pizza in a preheated 450F oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy.</li>
